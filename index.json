Defining the optimal target product profile (TPP) is complicated due to a wide range of possible vaccine properties, modalities and an incomplete understanding of the mechanism of natural immunity. We report consensus population level impact projections based on two mathematical models applied to a low income setting. Method: Two structurally distinct age-specific deterministic compartmental models reflecting uncertainty associated with the natural history of infection and the mechanism by which immunity is acquired and lost were constructed. A wide range of vaccine TPPs were explored including dosing regime and uptake, and effects in the vaccinated individual on infectiousness, susceptibility, duration of protection, disease severity and interaction with maternal antibodies and natural induced immunity. These were combined with a range of vaccine implementation strategies, targeting the highest priority age group and calibrated using hospitalization data from Kilifi County Hospital, Kenya. Findings: Both models were able to reproduce the data. The impact predicted by the two models was qualitatively similar across the range of TPPs, although one model consistently predicted higher impact than the other. For a proposed realistic range of scenarios of TPP combinations, the models predicted up to 70% reduction in hospitalizations in children under five years old. Vaccine designs which reduced the duration and infectiousness of infection were predicted to have higher impacts. The models were sensitive to the coverage and rate of loss of vaccine protection but not to the interaction between vaccine and maternal/naturally acquired immunity. Conclusion: The results suggest that vaccine properties leading to reduced virus circulation by lessening the duration and infectiousness of infection upon challenge are of major importance in population RSV disease control. These features should be a focus for vaccine development.","tags":["RSV models"],"title":"Predicting the relative impacts of maternal and neonatal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine target product profiles: A consensus modelling approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kinyanjui TM","Pellis L","House T"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1473597299,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1473597299,"objectID":"cddf90c7a8db80b30dea15ac53f1434f","permalink":"/publication/information/","publishdate":"2016-09-11T13:34:59+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/information/","section":"publication","summary":"Household structure is a key driver of many infectious diseases, as well as a natural target for interventions such as vaccination programs.

Two commonly used epidemiological study designs are considered: cross-sectional, where different households are sampled at every time point, and cohort, where the same households are followed over the course of the study period. The search for an optimal design uses Bayesian computationally intensive methods to explore the joint parameter-design space combined with the Shannon entropy of the posteriors to estimate the amount of information in each design. For the cross-sectional design, the amount of information increases with the sampling intensity, i.e., the designs with the highest number of time points have the most information. On the other hand, the cohort design often exhibits a trade-off between the number of households sampled and the intensity of follow-up. Our results broadly support the choices made in existing epidemiological data collection studies.

Development of vaccines for young infants is complicated by the presence of maternal antibodies and immunological immaturity, but vaccines targeted at older children avoid these problems. Vaccine development for young infants has been unsuccessful, but this is not the case for older children ( 6m). Would vaccinating older children have a significant public health impact? We developed a mathematical model to explore the benefits of a vaccine against RSV. Methods and Findings: We have used a deterministic age structured model capturing the key epidemiological characteristics of RSV and performed a statistical maximum-likelihood fit to age-specific hospitalization data from a developing country setting. To explore the effects of vaccination under different mixing assumptions, we included two versions of contact matrices: one from a social contact diary study, and the second a synthesised construction based on demographic data.

Consequently, vaccine development has centered on a vaccine to directly protect the infants in this age group. The fundamental problem is that these young infants are poor responders to candidate RSV vaccines. This thesis focuses on the use of mathematical models to explore the merits of vaccination. Methods: Following development and analysis of a simple non-age-structured ODE model, we elaborate this to a Realistic Age Structured model (RAS) capturing the key epidemiological characteristics of RSV and incorporating age-specific vaccination options. The compartmental ODE model was calibrated using agespecific and time series hospitalization data from a rural coastal Kenyan population. The determination of Who Acquires Infection From Whom (WAIFW) matrix was done using social contact data from 1) a synthetic mixing matrix generated from primarily household occupancy data and 2) a diary study that we conducted in the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS). The vaccine was assumed to elicit partial immunity equivalent to wild type infection and its impact was measured by the ratio of hospitalized RSV cases after to before introduction. of vaccination. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis were undertaken using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and partial rank correlation respectively. Given the importance of households in the transmission of respiratory infections, an exploratory household model was developed to capture the transmission dynamics of RSV A and B in a population of households. Results: From the analytical work of the simple ODE model, we have demonstrated that the model has the potential to exhibit a backward bifurcation curve within realistic parameter ranges. Both the diary and the synthetic mixing matrices had similar characteristics i.e. strong assortative mixing in individuals less than 30 years old and strong mixing between children less than 5 years and adults between 20 and 50 years old. When the two matrices were jointly linearly regressed, their elements were well correlated with an R2 ~ 0.6. The RAS model was capable of capturing the age-specific disease and the temporal epidemic nature of RSV in the specified location. Introduction of routine universal vaccination at ages varying from the first month of life to the 10th year of life resulted in optimal long-term benefit at 7 months (for the diary contact model) and 5 months (for the synthetic contact model). The greatest benefit arose under the assumption of age-related mixing with the contact diary data with no great deal of effectiveness lost when the vaccine is delayed between 5 and 12 months of age from birth. Vaccination was also shown to change the temporal dynamics of RSV hospitalizations and also to increase the average age at primary infection. From the sensitivity analysis, we identified the duration of RSV specific maternal antibodies, duration of primary and tertiary infections as the most important parameters in explaining the imprecision observed in predicting both the age specific hospitalizations and the optimal month at vaccination. Results from the household model have demonstrated that the household epidemic profile may be different from the general population with strong interaction of the viruses in the household that do not necessarily reflect at the population level. Conclusion: The synthetic matrix method would be a preferable alternative route in estimating mixing patterns in populations with the required socio-demographic data. Retrospectively, the synthetic mixing data can be used to reconstruct contact patterns in the past and therefore beneficial in assessing the effect of demographic transition in disease transmission. Universal infant vaccination has the potential to significantly reduce the burden of RSV associated disease, even with delayed vaccination between 5 and 12 months. This age class represents the group that is being targeted by vaccines that are currently under development. More accurate data measuring the duration of RSV specific maternal antibodies and the duration of infections are required to reduce the uncertainty in the model predictions.","tags":["RSV models"],"title":"Modelling the transmission dynamics of RSV and the impact of routine vaccination","type":"publication"}]
